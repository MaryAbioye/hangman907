## Project Title
Hangman Game

## Description
The Hangman Game is a simple implementation of the classic word guessing game. In this project, the player is tasked with guessing a hidden word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives), and if the player guesses all the unique letters in the word before losing all lives, they win the game.

### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project was to build a simple command-line version of the Hangman game using Python. The project involves concepts such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and methods.
- Handling user input and validating guesses.
- Implementing game loops and conditional statements.
- Managing the game state (such as lives, guessed letters, and the word being guessed).

### What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Structuring a Python program using classes and functions.
- Working with loops and conditionals to create an interactive game flow.
- Validating and processing user input.
- Organizing a project with clear separation of functionality into multiple files.
