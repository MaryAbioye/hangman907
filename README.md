# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

Description
This project is part of the milestone tasks aimed at improving Python programming skills and learning GitHub best practices. It focuses on:

Working with Python data structures such as lists.
Implementing conditional logic using if statements.
Taking user input and validating it.
Writing code collaboratively and documenting it for future reference.
The goal of the project is to create a Python program that randomly selects a word from a list, takes user input, and validates the input. This helps in building a foundational understanding of Python programming concepts.

What I Learned
How to use lists and the random.choice() method.
Taking and validating user input with Python's input() function.
Using Git for version control and documenting a project using GitHub's README file.

Project Description
This is a simple Python-based Word Guessing Game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player needs to guess letters of the word. The game continues until the player guesses a letter correctly.

Aim of the Project:
To create an interactive game where users can guess letters.
To practice Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and handling user input.
To improve code structure by refactoring and using functions for better readability and reusability.
What I Learned:
Implementing loops and conditionals for handling game logic.
Creating functions to organize the code and make it more reusable.
Validating user input to ensure correct data types are provided.
Installation Instructions
