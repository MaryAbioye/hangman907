## Description
This project is part of the milestone tasks aimed at improving Python programming skills and learning GitHub best practices. It focuses on:
- Working with Python data structures such as lists.
- Implementing conditional logic using `if` statements.
- Taking user input and validating it.
- Writing code collaboratively and documenting it for future reference.

The goal of the project is to create a Python program that randomly selects a word from a list, takes user input, and validates the input. This helps in building a foundational understanding of Python programming concepts.

### What I Learned
- How to use lists and the `random.choice()` method.
- Taking and validating user input with Python's `input()` function.
- Using Git for version control and documenting a project using GitHub's README file.

## Project Description

This is a simple Python-based Word Guessing Game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player needs to guess letters of the word. The game continues until the player guesses a letter correctly.

### Aim of the Project:
- To create an interactive game where users can guess letters.
- To practice Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and handling user input.
- To improve code structure by refactoring and using functions for better readability and reusability.

### What I Learned:
- Implementing loops and conditionals for handling game logic.
- Creating functions to organize the code and make it more reusable.
- Validating user input to ensure correct data types are provided.

## Project Description
The Hangman Game is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game. The goal is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time before running out of lives. This project is designed to:
- Practice fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Gain experience with object-oriented programming in Python.
- Explore good coding practices such as meaningful naming, code reuse, and proper documentation.

**What I Learned:**
- Using classes and methods to structure Python programs.
- Implementing error handling and input validation.
- Writing reusable and maintainable code.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone url

## Description
The **Hangman Game** is a Python-based project where users attempt to guess a randomly chosen word by guessing individual letters. The game provides a fun way to improve logical thinking and Python programming skills.

### **Aim of the Project**
- To simulate a classic word-guessing game using Python.
- To enhance skills in object-oriented programming (OOP), including class design and methods.
- To apply best practices like code refactoring, meaningful naming, and modular design.

### **What I Learned**
- Object-oriented programming in Python.
- Handling user input and validating data.
- Designing interactive console-based applications.
- Writing reusable and well-structured code.
